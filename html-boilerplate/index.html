        <h1>Intro to Programming</h1>
            What is Programming?
            <p>Essentially programming is telling a computer what to do. Programming is
                the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how 
                to perform a task.
                <br>
                Programming can be done using a variety of computer "languages," such as
                 Python, Rust, Javascript, Java, Swift, C# and C++.
            </p>
        <h2>Fundamental Concepts</h2>
            <p>Programming involves basic concepts that are present in most if not all
                languages. The include but are not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Variables</li>
                <li>Data Types</li>
                <li>Data Structures</li>
                <li>Operators</li>
                <li>Expressions</li>
                <li>Statements</li>
                <li>Conditionals</li>
                <li>Loops</li>
                <li>Functions</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        <h2>Other Concepts</h2>
            <p>
                There are other concepts that are in some but not all languages.
                Whether or not a language has these concepts is usually dependent on 
                the paradigm of the language. These include but are not limited to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Classes</li>
                    <li>Objects</li>
                    <li>Methods</li>
                    <li>Interfaces<sup>[1]</sup></li>
                    <li>Enumerations</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <h2>Paradigms in Programming</h2>
            <p>
                So what are these paradigms we keep hearing about?
                <br>
                A paradigm is a way of thinking about something that shapes how we 
                interpret information and make decisions. In the context of 
                programming, a paradigm is the way the programmer thinks about the
                operations, which shapes how they give the computer instructions
                and determins how the code is written.
                <br>
                There are many different paradigms in programming. A language can 
                belong to multiple paradigms, indicating multiple ways of writing
                code in that language. Such languages are termed "multiparadigm". 
                Some of the most common paradigms in programming are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Imperative Programming</li>
                    <li>Declarative Programming</li>
                    <li>Functional Programming</li>
                    <li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
                    <li>Procedural Programming</li>
                    <li>Event-Driven Programming</li>
                    <li>Logic Programming</li>
                    <li>Aspect-Oriented Programming</li>
                    <li>Concurrent Programming</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <h2>Translation</h2>
        <p>
            When you write code, you are writing in a language that <em>you</em> can read 
            and understand. The computer however understands <em>only</em> machine code, so
            your code has to be "translated" into machine code that the computer understands.
            There are two ways that a computer can run code: 
            <ol>
                <li>compilation</li> 
                <li>interpretation</li>
            </ol>
            Compiled languages are languages that are compiled into machine code 
            (by a compiler), which is platform-specific code that the computer can 
            understand. Interpreted languages are languages that are interpreted by 
            a program (called the interpreter), which is then run by the computer.
            <br>
            Compiled languages (eg C/C++) are generally <del>much</del> faster than interpreted 
            languages,but interpreted languages (eg Python) are generally easier to write and 
            debug but the compiled code will only run on a particular platform as machine code 
            is platform-specific.
            <br>
            Some languages (eg Java) are both compiled and interpreted. These languages are 
            compiled into an intermediate language, which is then interpreted by another 
            program. This allows the code to be run on multiple platforms without having to be 
            recompiled for each platform.
        </p>
        <h2>Typing</h2>
        <p>
            When you write code, you'll use different data types. Typing is a way for the 
            interpeter to keep track of the types. There are two types of typing in 
            programming: 
            <ol>
                <li>static typing</li>
                <li>dynamic typing</li>
            </ol>
            Static typing is when the type of a variable is determined at compile time.
            <br>
            Dynamic typing is when the type of a variable is determined at runtime.
            <br>
            Static typing is generally considered to be safer than dynamic typing, but
            dynamic typing is generally considered to be easier to write and debug.
            <br>
            There are also languages that are both statically and dynamically typed.
            These languages are statically typed, but the type of a variable can be 
            inferred at compile time.
            <br>
            There also two different approaches to type checking. These are:
            <ol>
                <li>strong typing</li>
                <li>weak typing</li>
            </ol>
            Strong typing requires that the types of variables and expressions be checked 
            at compile time. This means that the compiler will not allow you to assign a 
            value of one type to a variable of another type. Strong typing can help to 
            prevent errors and make code more robust.
            <br>
            Weak typing does not require that the types of variables and expressions be 
            checked at compile time. This means that the compiler may allow you to assign 
            a value of one type to a variable of another type. Weak typing can make code 
            more flexible, but it can also make it more error-prone.
